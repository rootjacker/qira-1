So sadly, Google Code doesn't have pull requests. You have two options. One, clone this repo on Google Code, and push your changes there. Two, clone this repo on any git site.

Post a comment here with the git URL and a short description of the change, and I'll pull in your changes if they are quality. In general, changes that make things simpler > changes that make things more complicated.

# Do we want bugfixes? #

Yes!

# Do we want feature X? #

If the feature isn't likely to break, and is fairly orthogonal to the main code, then it probably doesn't hurt to include it.

# How can I add support for arch X? #

Commit d5dca49b added PPC, you'll probably have to do something very similar, so look at that commit.

# How can I become a commiter here? #

Make worthwhile changes using the above method, after a few good ones where you've shown to add value and not break the build, I'll add you.
